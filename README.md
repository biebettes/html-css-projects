## My process

- Firstly, the content of the page was included using HTML. Appropriate tags and classes were defined to ensure feasibility to read and style using CSS. I avoided naming each tag so that pseudo-classes like "nth-of-type" can be utilized while styling for better practice and concept retention. Since the project is created from frontendmentor.io challenges, the width sizes are defined to attain the closest visual appeal to the overall design provided.

- While styling, firstly the Blog Preview Card was aligned as per the design. Following, the implementation of styles on font size, weight, and family. Later, the active state effects such as box-shadow, transitions, and color changes were implemented. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

As a newbie still in progress to complete online courses for front-end development, I applied @media rule and learnt the syntax to apply the box-shadow property. Also, through the project, I used <svg> in my code for the first time.  

### Continued development

- would like to work more on using SVGs
- make a practice of writing comment lines for feasibility
- enhance code readability 
- combine properties wherver possible to omit code redundancy

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/box-shadow/) - This helped me for adding and tweaking the border as needed with complete explanation of the syntax and how to use it. I like the complete and easy-to-understand sequence of this article.
